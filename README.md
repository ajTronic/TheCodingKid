## Running Projects

Watch my [setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3X2CEdcTSU&ab_channel=TheCodingKid) to install the requirements to run these projects.
Then, after you've downloaded the projects, you can simply open each project folder (e.g. TheCodingKid/Challenges/MouseTrail) in VS Code and hit 'Live Server'.
